# Sentiment_analysis_using_ML

I collected data containing employee feedback encompassing various aspects such as salary, job, and working culture, along with their likes and dislikes. I conducted Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) processes on this dataset to prepare it for analysis. Subsequently, I performed data visualization to gain insights from the information. Ultimately, I developed a machine learning model capable of predicting sentiment, determining whether it is a positive "like" or negative "dislike" sentiment.
